# CLI Implementation

The CLI application provides development tools and utilities for working with our map format and game projects.

## CLI Architecture
- Located in `apps/cli/` directory
- Structured with commands, actions, and types
- Uses yargs for command-line argument parsing
- ESM module structure with TypeScript

## Command Structure
- Commands are defined in `src/commands/` directory
- Each command has a dedicated file exporting a Command object
- Commands are registered in `main.ts` 
- Follow the existing pattern for adding new commands:
  ```typescript
  export const myCommand: Command<MyArgs> = {
      command: 'command-name <required> [optional]',
      describe: 'Description of the command',
      builder: (yargs) => { /* argument definitions */ },
      handler: async (argv) => { /* command implementation */ }
  }
  ```

## Action Implementation
- Core functionality is implemented in `src/actions/` directory
- Actions are imported by commands but can be reused
- Keep actions focused on single responsibilities
- Use asynchronous functions where appropriate
- Provide detailed logging for operation status

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the project's TypeScript standards
- Provide helpful error messages and proper error handling
- Include detailed command descriptions and help text
- Test commands with various input scenarios
- Document command usage in README files

## Utilities
- Format conversion tools
- Asset management helpers
- Validation utilities
