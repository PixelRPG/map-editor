# GJS Packages

GJS packages (`*-gjs`) implement core interfaces for the GNOME JavaScript (GJS) runtime environment, enabling desktop-based applications with GTK.

## Package Responsibilities
- Implement interfaces defined in corresponding core packages
- Provide GTK-friendly APIs and components
- Handle GNOME-specific UI patterns and integrations
- Bridge between core interfaces and GJS/GTK functionality
- Focus on desktop application integration

## Implementation Patterns
- Use GObject-style classes with proper inheritance
- Follow GNOME naming conventions and patterns
- Handle GJS-specific memory management concerns
- Use GTK modern patterns (like composite templates)
- Properly integrate with GObject-introspection

## UI Components
- Create reusable GTK widgets and components
- Follow GNOME Human Interface Guidelines
- Implement responsive layouts
- Handle proper resource management
- Support accessibility features

## Integration with Core Packages
- Implement core interfaces faithfully
- Translate between core types and GJS/GTK types
- Handle platform-specific edge cases
- Provide GJS-specific extensions where needed
- Maintain type safety in interface implementations

## Message Handling
- Implement the message system defined in core packages
- Translate between engine messages and GTK/GJS events
- Handle input events from GTK and forward to appropriate handlers
- Use message passing for communication between components
- Ensure type safety in message handling
