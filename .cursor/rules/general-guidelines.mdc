# General Guidelines

## Project Structure
- The project is organized into `packages/*` (reusable libraries) and `apps/*` (end-user applications)
- Each package follows a consistent naming pattern:
  - `*-core`: Core interfaces, types, and platform-independent functionality
  - `*-gjs`: GJS/GTK implementation for desktop environments
  - `*-excalibur`: Web/Excalibur.js implementation for browsers
  - `*-web`: Web-specific utilities and components for standard browser environments
  - `*-webview`: WebKit webview specific implementations for native applications

## Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript with explicit types for all public interfaces
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` with proper type guards
- Document all public interfaces with JSDoc comments
- Create type guards for runtime type checking
- Use generics for better type inference
- Ensure proper nullability handling

## File Organization
- Group related types in logical files
- Use index files to re-export public APIs
- Keep implementation details private when possible
- Maintain consistent file naming conventions
- Separate types from implementation code
  - Types go in `types/` directory
  - Implementation code goes in appropriate directories based on functionality

## Error Handling
- Validate input data thoroughly
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use proper error types for different failure scenarios
- Log warnings for non-critical issues
- Handle edge cases explicitly

## Message Passing
- Use the established message passing system for communication between components
- Create properly typed messages using helper functions
- Use enum values instead of string literals for message types
- Handle message parsing with appropriate type guards
- Document message flow between components

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Maintain runtime independence in core packages
- Handle platform-specific concerns in appropriate packages
- Use feature detection instead of platform detection when possible
