# Application Architecture

End-user applications in the `apps/` directory should follow these architectural guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Application Structure
- Organize code into logical modules and components
- Separate UI components from business logic
- Use a consistent directory structure
- Follow platform-specific conventions (GJS or web)
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## UI Components
- Create reusable, composable components
- Implement responsive layouts
- Follow platform UI guidelines (GNOME HIG or web best practices)
- Handle proper resource management
- Support accessibility features

## State Management
- Use appropriate state management patterns
- Avoid global state when possible
- Implement proper data flow between components
- Handle asynchronous operations cleanly
- Ensure type safety in state transitions

## Error Handling
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Provide recovery mechanisms when possible
- Use proper error boundaries

## Integration with Packages
- Use packages from the `packages/` directory
- Follow the interfaces defined in core packages
- Handle platform-specific concerns appropriately
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Document integration points
