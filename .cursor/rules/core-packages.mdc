# Core Packages

Core packages (`*-core`) provide the foundation for the project, defining interfaces, types, and platform-independent functionality that other packages implement.

## Package Responsibilities
- Define interfaces and types that will be implemented by platform-specific packages
- Provide platform-independent utility functions and services
- Establish the contract between different parts of the system
- Avoid dependencies on platform-specific libraries or frameworks
- Focus on reusability and extensibility

## Type Definitions
- Define clear, well-documented interfaces for all major components
- Use TypeScript interfaces for object shapes and types for unions/primitives
- Create type guards for runtime type checking
- Use discriminated unions with explicit type properties
- Document nullability and optional parameters

## Implementation Guidelines
- Keep core implementations platform-agnostic
- Provide default implementations where appropriate
- Use dependency injection patterns for extensibility
- Avoid direct dependencies on browser, Node.js, or GJS APIs
- Create factory functions for instantiating complex objects

## Error Handling
- Define error types and hierarchies
- Create error factory functions for consistent error creation
- Include appropriate context in error objects
- Document error conditions in interface definitions
- Provide utilities for error handling and reporting

## Message System
- Define message types and structures
- Create message factory functions
- Establish message validation patterns
- Document message flow and handling expectations
- Provide utilities for message serialization/deserialization
