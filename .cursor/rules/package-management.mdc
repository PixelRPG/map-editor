# Package Management

This project uses Yarn workspaces for package management, with a monorepo structure.

## Workspace Structure
- Root workspace in the project root
- Packages in `packages/` directory
- Applications in `apps/` directory
- Each package and app has its own `package.json`

## Dependencies
- Use workspace references for internal dependencies
- Specify exact versions for external dependencies
- Document dependency purposes in package.json
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Minimize external dependencies

## Scripts
- Implement consistent script names across packages
- Include build, test, and lint scripts
- Use workspace-level scripts for project-wide operations
- Document script usage in README files
- Ensure scripts work cross-platform
