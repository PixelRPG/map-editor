# Package Management Standards

This project uses the latest version of Yarn as its package manager.

## Yarn Usage

- Use Yarn for all package management operations
- Do not mix package managers (no npm or pnpm commands)
- Always use Yarn v3+ (Berry) features when available
- Include yarn.lock in version control

## Command Standards

Always use consistent yarn commands in documentation and scripts:

```bash
# Installing dependencies
yarn install

# Adding dependencies
yarn add <package>
yarn add -D <package>  # dev dependency

# Removing dependencies
yarn remove <package>

# Running scripts
yarn <script-name>

# Building
yarn build

# Testing
yarn test

# Workspace commands
yarn workspace <workspace-name> <command>
```

## Workspace Configuration

- Use Yarn workspaces for monorepo management
- Define workspaces in the root package.json
- Maintain consistent versioning across packages
- Use workspace protocols for internal dependencies:
  
```json
"dependencies": {
    "@pixelrpg/data-core": "workspace:^"
}
```

## Documentation Standards

- All README files and documentation should reference yarn commands only
- Update examples to use yarn when modifying documentation
- Ensure CI/CD pipelines use yarn consistently
