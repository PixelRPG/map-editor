# Code Quality Standards

Maintain high code quality standards across all packages:

TypeScript Usage:
- Use explicit types for all public interfaces
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes and types for unions/primitives
- Document all public interfaces with JSDoc comments

File Organization:
- Group related types in logical files
- Use index files to re-export public APIs
- Keep implementation details private when possible
- Maintain consistent file naming conventions

Error Handling:
- Validate input data thoroughly
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use proper error types for different failure scenarios
- Log warnings for non-critical issues
