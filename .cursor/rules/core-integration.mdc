# Core Package Architecture

The core packages (with `-core` suffix) provide runtime-independent foundations for our systems. These packages are designed to be used across different runtime environments without modification, serving as the shared foundation for various implementations.

## Core Package Responsibilities
- Define fundamental data structures and interfaces
- Provide validation logic for data formats
- Implement serialization/deserialization utilities
- Maintain runtime-agnostic implementations (no dependencies on specific platforms)
- Focus on data representation, not rendering or interaction
- Establish common utilities and helper functions

## Integration with Runtime-Specific Packages
Core packages are complemented by runtime-specific implementations:
- `-excalibur` suffix: Integration with Excalibur.js game engine
- `-gjs` suffix: Integration with GNOME's JavaScript runtime (GJS)
- `-web` suffix: General browser/web implementation
- Other suffixes may be added for additional runtime targets

These specialized packages depend on the core packages and provide:
- Runtime-specific resource loaders
- Conversion from core data structures to runtime-specific objects
- Rendering and interaction implementations
- Additional utilities specific to each runtime environment
- Platform-specific optimizations

## Development Guidelines
When working with core packages:
- Maintain strict runtime independence
- Ensure comprehensive validation of all data structures
- Use explicit TypeScript interfaces with thorough JSDoc documentation
- Avoid dependencies that would tie the core to specific runtimes
- Design with extensibility in mind for future runtime integrations
- Keep APIs consistent across different core packages
- Minimize external dependencies to reduce potential conflicts
