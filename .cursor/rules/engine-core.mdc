# Engine Core Architecture

The `engine-core` package provides the foundation for game engine functionality across different runtime environments. It defines interfaces, types, and base implementations that are used by platform-specific engine implementations.

## Package Responsibilities
- Define engine interfaces and abstract classes
- Establish message types for communication between engine components
- Provide event handling mechanisms
- Define input event types and structures
- Establish engine lifecycle states and transitions
- Implement runtime-agnostic utility functions

## Message System Architecture
The engine uses a unified message system for communication:

- **Message Types**: All messages follow a consistent type structure defined in `messages.types.ts`
- **Message Categories**:
  - `EngineMessageType.LOAD_PROJECT`: For loading game projects
  - `EngineMessageType.LOAD_MAP`: For loading and changing maps
  - `EngineMessageType.ENGINE_EVENT`: For engine state changes and notifications
  - `EngineMessageType.INPUT_EVENT`: For user input events
  - `EngineMessageType.COMMAND`: For engine control commands

- **Command Types**:
  - `EngineCommandType.START`: Start the engine
  - `EngineCommandType.STOP`: Stop the engine
  - `EngineCommandType.PAUSE`: Pause the engine
  - `EngineCommandType.RESUME`: Resume the engine

## Engine Lifecycle
The engine follows a defined lifecycle with these states:
- `INITIALIZING`: Engine is being set up
- `READY`: Engine is ready but not running
- `RUNNING`: Engine is actively running
- `PAUSED`: Engine is paused
- `ERROR`: Engine encountered an error
- `STOPPED`: Engine has been stopped

## Integration with Runtime-Specific Implementations
- Runtime-specific packages extend the core interfaces
- Platform implementations handle rendering, input, and resource management
- Core interfaces ensure consistent behavior across platforms

## Development Guidelines
When working with the engine core:
- Maintain strict runtime independence
- Use explicit TypeScript interfaces with thorough documentation
- Avoid dependencies on specific rendering engines
- Design with extensibility in mind
- Keep message types consistent and well-defined
- Ensure proper error handling and state management
- Use type safety to prevent runtime errors

## Relationship to Other Packages
- `engine-core` depends on `messages-core` for basic message structures
- Runtime-specific engine packages (like `engine-excalibur` and `engine-gjs`) implement the interfaces defined in `engine-core`
- Applications use the appropriate runtime-specific engine implementation
