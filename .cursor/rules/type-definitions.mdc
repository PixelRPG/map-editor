# Type Definitions

Type definitions are critical for our data formats:
- Use explicit interfaces for all data structures
- Provide comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Use strict typing to catch errors at compile time
- Breaking changes are allowed when making changes

Key type definitions:
- MapData: The core map structure
- LayerData: Layer information within a map
- SpriteSetData: Sprite set information
- SpriteData: Individual sprite information
- AnimationData: Animation definitions
- ColliderShape: Collision shape definitions
- GameProjectData: Project configuration that references maps and sprite sets
- ObjectData: Game objects with position, size, and properties

When modifying types:
- Update validation logic in corresponding format classes
- Consider the impact on both core and engine-specific implementations
- Add appropriate JSDoc comments for all public interfaces
- Ensure proper handling of coordinate systems in all object positioning code

These rules should be continuously updated as the project evolves. When I provide new information about project goals or implementation details, suggest updates to these rules.
