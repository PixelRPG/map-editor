# Web Packages

Web packages (`*-web`) provide utilities and components for web browser integration, focusing on communication and integration with web technologies.

## Package Responsibilities
- Implement browser-specific functionality
- Handle web communication patterns
- Provide utilities for DOM manipulation
- Bridge between core interfaces and web APIs
- Focus on web application integration

## Implementation Patterns
- Use modern browser APIs and features
- Follow web development best practices
- Handle browser compatibility concerns
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Properly integrate with the DOM and browser events

## Message Handling
- Use standard WebKit message handlers (window.webkit.messageHandlers) when available
- Implement WHATWG window.postMessage API as a fallback mechanism
- Follow web standards for cross-context communication
- Implement the abstract classes from message-channel-core package
- Provide automatic detection and use of available communication channels
- Ensure proper error handling and type safety in message passing

## Integration with Core Packages
- Implement core interfaces faithfully
- Translate between core types and web types
- Handle platform-specific edge cases
- Provide web-specific extensions where needed
- Maintain type safety in interface implementations
