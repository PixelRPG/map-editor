# Web Packages

Web packages (`*-web`) provide utilities and components for web browser integration, focusing on communication and integration with web technologies.

## Package Responsibilities
- Implement browser-specific functionality
- Handle web communication patterns
- Provide utilities for DOM manipulation
- Bridge between core interfaces and web APIs
- Focus on web application integration

## Implementation Patterns
- Use modern browser APIs and features
- Follow web development best practices
- Handle browser compatibility concerns
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Properly integrate with the DOM and browser events

## Message Handling
- Implement the message system defined in core packages
- Handle cross-origin communication when needed
- Provide utilities for serialization/deserialization
- Ensure type safety in message handling
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous communication

## Integration with Core Packages
- Implement core interfaces faithfully
- Translate between core types and web types
- Handle platform-specific edge cases
- Provide web-specific extensions where needed
- Maintain type safety in interface implementations
