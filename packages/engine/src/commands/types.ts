 * Editor mutation primitive. Every state change the editor performs

 * `Engine.executeCommand`. The command captures enough information
 * in its `payload` to:
 *
 * 1. **Apply** the mutation locally.
 * 2. **Revert** the mutation locally (for Undo).
 * 3. **Serialise** as an `Operation` (for future collab + Replay).
 *
 * See `docs/concepts/editor-architecture.md` § Migration / Phase 5
 * and `docs/concepts/collaboration-and-multiplayer.md` for the
 * three-fold use.
 *
 * Stable-IDs rule: every payload references stable identifiers
 * (`LayerData.id`, `ObjectPlacement.id`, tile coords, …) — **never**
 * Excalibur runtime entity ids. The command must survive scene
 * reload, save/load, and (later) cross-peer broadcast.

 *
 * `direction` is the apply/revert discriminator used by the
 * undo/redo replication path:
 *   - `'apply'` (default when missing) — receiver runs `command.apply`.
 *     Emitted by initial command execution + redo.
 *   - `'revert'` — receiver runs `command.revert`. Emitted by undo.
 *
 * Older peers (pre-direction-field) sent operations without the
 * field; receivers default to `'apply'` so existing wire traffic
 * continues to work unchanged.
 *
 * `origin` is attribution-only: the actor that INITIATED the
 * mutation when it differs from the sending peer's human user —
 * today that's the in-process AI collaborator
 * (`ASSISTANT_PEER_ID`) driving the host's engine via Control/MCP.
 * It deliberately does NOT replace `peerId`: sequence counters,
 * echo suppression and the snapshot `opWatermark` all key on
 * `(peerId, seq)` — the transport/session identity — and an op the
 * AI initiates is still sent (and deduped) as the hosting peer's
 * op. Absent = initiated by `peerId`'s own user (also what older
 * peers without the field send).
